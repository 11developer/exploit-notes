## Compress

```sh
zip <output> <target1> <target2> ...

zip example.zip example1.txt example2.txt
# -r: recursive (zip folder)
zip -r example.zip ./example
```

## Decompress

```sh
unzip example.zip
# Specify the directory to decompress
unzip example.zip -d ./example
```

## List Files in a Zip File

To list files in a zip file without extracting, use **`-l`** flag.

```bash
unzip -l example.zip
```

<br />

## Unzip with Python

Also we can decompress an archived file using Python script.

```py
import zipfile

filename = "./sample.zip"
extdir = "./"
password = "password123"

with zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r') as zp:
    try:
        zp.extractall(path=extdir, pwd=password.encode('utf-8'))
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```
